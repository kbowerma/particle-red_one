# Red One
this is on P1 redboard from sparkfun so I have modified the master make file and adpated the ```build``` to a new ```p1build``` which includes ```PLATFORM=P1 PRODUCT_ID=8 ```.  You have to remember to do a ```make clean``` if you forget and do just a ```make build``` instead of a ```make p1build```
